A vacation is when you take a trip to some _fill_ with your family. Usually you go to some palace that is near a _fill_ or up on a _fill_. A good vacation place is one where you can ride a _fill_ or play _fill_ or go hunting for _fill_. I like to spend my time running. When parents go on vacation, they spend their time eating three _fill_.
